Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are type of identifier for verifiable,
decentralized digital identity. These identifiers are designed to enable the
controller of a DID to prove control over it and to be implemented
independently of any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate
authority. It can sometimes be useful to be able to reference an identifier
that represents nothing. This document defines such a DID.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) [[DID-CORE]] are a type of identifier for
verifiable, decentralized digital identity. These identifiers are designed
to enable the controller of a DID to prove control over it and to be
implemented independently of any centralized registry, identity provider, or
certificate authority. It can sometimes be useful to be able to reference an
identifier that represents nothing. This document defines such a DID.
      </p>

      <p>
The rest of this document outlines the syntax for the <tt>did:null</tt> method,
the operations it supports, and some security and privacy considerations that
implementers might want to be aware of when implementing.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
The name "null" was somewhat arbitrarily chosen based on how common its use is
in computer programming languages. There are many other similar names which
could equally be used for the same concept presented here: 0, zero, void, none,
empty, false, undefined, nil, and likely others.

      <h2 id="format">The did:null Format</h2>

      <p>
The format for the <tt>did:null</tt> method conforms to the [[DID-CORE]]
specification and is simple. It consists of only <code>did:null:null</code>.
No <tt>method-specific-id</tt> other than <code>null</code> is specified in
this specification version and other values should be rejected.
      </p>

      <p>
The ABNF for the null format is described below:
      </p>

      <pre>
did-null-format    = "did:" method-name ":" method-specific-id
method-name        = "null"
method-specific-id = "null"
      </pre>

      <p>
The single example of a valid <tt>did:null</tt> DID is:
      </p>

      <pre class="example" title="A simple did:null value">
did:null:null
      </pre>

    </section>

    <section class="normative">
      <h2>Operations</h2>

      <p>
The following section outlines the DID operations for the <tt>did:null</tt>
method. Implementers might note that this DID Method is purely static,
requiring no look ups in a registry. Since the <tt>did:null</tt> value is not
stored in any registry, it cannot be updated or deactivated.
      </p>

      <section class="normative">
        <h3>Create</h3>

        <p>
Creation of a <tt>did:null</tt> DID Document always results in the same
document for the DID <tt>did:null:null</tt>. It is described in full here:
        </p>

        <pre class="example" title="The did:null:null DID Document">
          {
            "@context": [
              "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"
            ],
            "id": "did:null:null"
          }
        </pre>
      </section>

      <section class="normative">
        <h3>Read</h3>

        <p>
Reading the <tt>did:null:null</tt> value is a matter of deterministically
expanding the value to a DID Document described in Section <a
href="#create"></a>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="normative">
        <h3>Update</h3>

        <p>
This DID Method does not support updating the DID Document.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="normative">
        <h3>Deactivate</h3>

        <p>
This DID Method does not support deactivating the DID Document.
        </p>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Test Vectors</h2>
      <p>For a full list of test vectors see <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/did-method-null-spec/tree/main/test-vectors">test vectors</a>.</p>
      
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>null</h3>
          <p>There is only one test vector and it has no contents.</p>
        <pre class="example">
          did:null:null

      </section>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p>
There are a number of security and privacy considerations that implementers
will want to take into consideration when implementing this specification.
      </p>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Deactivation Not Supported</h3>

        <p>
The <tt>did:null</tt> method is a purely static method, which means that
deactivation is not supported. This can be an issue if a future system wants
to change the behavior of <tt>did:null:null</tt>.
